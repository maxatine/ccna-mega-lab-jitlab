# CCNA Mega Lab â€“ Jeremyâ€™s IT Lab

This repository contains my personal implementation of the **CCNA Mega Lab** created by [Jeremyâ€™s IT Lab](https://www.youtube.com/@JeremysITLab), a YouTube channel focused on Ciscoâ€™s CCNA certification.

## Network Topology

The following image shows the complete topology used in this lab:

## Objective

To reinforce understanding of key CCNA topics by applying them in a complete lab environment with multiple routers, switches, and PCs â€” simulating a realistic enterprise topology.

## Tools Used

- **Cisco Packet Tracer 8.2.2**
- Environment: Simulated
- `.pka` file included in the repository

## Topics Covered

- IPv4 Addressing and Subnetting
- VLANs and Inter-VLAN Routing
- Layer-2 and Layer-3 EtherChannel, HSRP
- Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol
- Static and Dynamic Routing (OSPF)
- Network Services: DHCP, DNS, NTP, SNMP, Syslog, FTP, SSH, NAT
- Security: ACLs and Layer-2 Security Features
- IPv6
- Wireless

## Notes

- All configurations were made manually, based on Jeremyâ€™s video series, with a focus on CLI practice.
- The lab was tested in Packet Tracer, but the concepts apply to GNS3 or real Cisco hardware as well.
